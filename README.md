# Connect-4-Game
🎮 Connect 4 AI - Adversarial Search

📌 Project Overview
This project implements AI agents to play Connect 4 using adversarial search techniques. The AI players use algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves.

🔥 Features
Connect 4 board representation using NumPy
Minimax Algorithm for decision-making
Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize search efficiency
Heuristic Evaluation for smarter move selection
Matplotlib-based board visualization

🎯 Game Rules
Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to align four discs in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Matplotlib

📊 Results
The AI makes optimal moves using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
The game state is visualized after each move.

🔮 Future Improvements
Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for stronger AI.
Add a GUI-based interface for better gameplay experience.
Train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN) agent.
